# HangMan

When I first began my programming journey back in 2017, I learned the fundementals of Java in order to create my first game, Tic-Tac-Toe! This began my interest in programming games in python, which led me to creating a HangMan program. This is a game I used to always enjoy playing as a kid, which is why I decided to create this program. Hope you enjoy!
